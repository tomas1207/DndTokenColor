Very Tiny Module that lets you easily place coloured dots on tokens to keep track of, well, whatever you want.

**System compatability:**

The module requires the PF2E system and a Foundry version of V9 or higher.

**How to use:**

The effects do not need to be exported from compendiums to the items tab. 
Instead, You can use the provided macro while having a token selected to open the ChoiceSet dialogue, allowing you to select any of the provided effects while only using one macro slot. Remove the effect from the effects tab or the effects bar at the top right.

**Automation:**

The effects include no automation. They are purely visual indicators for whatever you want them to mean.

**Preview:**

Macro opens easy dialogue to pick color (You can also hover over a token without selecting, and then press the macro hotkey!)
