**System compatability:**

The module requires the PF2E system and a Foundry version of V9 or higher.

**How to use:**

The effects do not need to be exported from compendiums to the items tab. 
Instead, You can use the provided macro while having a token selected to open the ChoiceSet dialogue, allowing you to select any of the provided effects while only using one macro slot. Remove the effect from the effects tab or the effects bar at the top right.

If you don't want to keep the module enabled, you can make a copy of the compendiums to your world before you disable it to continue using the effects without needing to import them.

**Automation:**

Each effect includes no automation. They are purely visual indicators for whatever you want them to mean.

**Preview:**
